To compile common (required before compiling the server and client):
cc -g  -Wall -o common.o -c common.c

To compile the client (make would also work as the makefile was made for):
cc -g  -Wall -o client.o -c client.c; cc -g -o client common.o client.o 

To compile the server:
cc -g  -Wall -o server.o -c server.c; cc -g -o server common.o server.o 

They should all compile without warnings.

I was able to have a fully functional client with 2 player server (4).
There nevertheless is a problem with the recvfrom line 53 of the client. 
At some moments the code freezes there and the client will not receive anymore.
I was unable to find the cause of this crash (which does not raise any error).
I apologize in advance if you encounter this bug during testing.

The FYI communication was rewritten: the server sends a 9 character long string
with the entire grid inside ('.' for empty space and 'O'/'X' for players).
This sends a constant 9 chars compared to the last one which send between 3 and
27 chars (a lot more).
